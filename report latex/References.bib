abstract={The road sign classification system is a very important task for a lot of intelligent transportation system (ITS) applications , including autonomous car, and road/traffic flow mapping. In this paper, we proposed a spatial pyramid convolu-tional neural network classifier for road sign classification problem. To provide a detail image structure, two-level of spatial pyramid configuration is used as input to the classi-fier. The spatial pyramid CNN classifier is built on the top of AlexNet CNN architecture. Our spatial pyramid CNN clas-sifier consists of five streams and each stream is built from convolution layer of AlexNet CNN architecture. At the end of the classifier, we use the fully-connected part of AlexNet to classify the final classification result. As a result, our experiments show that the average accuracy of the classifier is 99.6% and it outperforms our previous approach on Japan image road sign dataset.},

pages={6721-6733},
abstract={In this paper, we are reporting a system for detection and classification of road signs. This system consists of two parts. The first part detects the road signs in real time. The second part classifies the German traffic signs (GTSRB) dataset and makes the prediction using the road signs detected in the first part to test the effectiveness. We used HOG and SVM in the detection part to detect the road signs captured by the camera. Then we used a convolutional neural network based on the LeNet model in which some modifications were added in the classification part. Our system obtains an accuracy rate of 96.85% in the detection part and 96.23% in the classification part.},

title={Autonomous Traffic Sign (ATSR) Detection and Recognition using Deep CNN},
journal={Procedia computer science},
volume={163},
pages={266-274},
abstract={Automatic detection and recognition of traffic signs is very important and could potentially be used for driver assistance to reduce accidents and eventually in driverless automobiles. In this paper, Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to develop an Autonomous Traffic and Road Sign (ATRS) detection and recognition system. The proposed system works in real time detecting and recognizing traffic sign images. The contribution of this paper is also a newly developed database of 24 different traffic signs collected from random road sides in Saudi Arabia. The images were taken from different angles and including other parameters and conditions. A total of 2718 images were collected to form the database which we named Saudi Arabian Traffic and Road Signs (SA-TRS-2018). The CNN architecture was used with varying parameters in order to achieve the best recognition rates. Experimental results show that the proposed CNN architecture achieved an accuracy of 100%, thus higher than those achieved in similar previous studies.},

title={Improved Faster R-CNN Traffic Sign Detection Based on a Second Region of Interest and Highly Possible Regions Proposal Network},
journal={Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)},
volume={19},
number={10},
pages={2288},
abstract={Traffic sign detection systems provide important road control information for unmanned driving systems or auxiliary driving. In this paper, the Faster region with a convolutional neural network (R-CNN) for traffic sign detection in real traffic situations has been systematically improved. First, a first step region proposal algorithm based on simplified Gabor wavelets (SGWs) and maximally stable extremal regions (MSERs) is proposed. In this way, the region proposal a priori information is obtained and will be used for improving the Faster R-CNN. This part of our method is named as the highly possible regions proposal network (HP-RPN). Second, in order to solve the problem that the Faster R-CNN cannot effectively detect small targets, a method that combines the features of the third, fourth, and fifth layers of VGG16 to enrich the features of small targets is proposed. Third, the secondary region of interest method to enhance the feature of detection objects and improve the classification capability of the Faster R-CNN is proposed. Finally, a method of merging the German traffic sign detection benchmark (GTSDB) and Chinese traffic sign dataset (CTSD) databases into one larger database to increase the number of database samples is proposed. Experimental results show that our method improves the detection performance, especially for small targets.},

title={Road surface traffic sign detection with hybrid region proposal and fast R-CNN},
publisher={IEEE},
pages={555-559},
abstract={Detection of traffic signs plays an important role in autonomous driving, traffic surveillance and traffic safety. Previous research in Traffic Sign Detection (TSD) generally focused on traffic signs which are over the roads, the traffic signs on road surface have not been discussed. In this paper, we propose a road surface traffic sign detection system by applying convolutional neural network (CNN). The proposed system consists of two main stages: 1) a hybrid region proposal method to hypothesize the traffic sign locations by taking into account complementary information of color and edge; 2) feature extraction, classification, bounding box regression and non-maximum suppression by Fast R-CNN. Extensive experiments have been conducted using our field-captured dataset, demonstrating outstanding performance with regard to high recall and precision rate. The overall average precision (AP) is about 85.58%.},
